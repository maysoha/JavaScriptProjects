# Digital Clock

<h2>Displaying real time date and time. Developed using JavaScript, HTML & CSS</h2>
<p>This code defines a digital clock using JavaScript and HTML. The JavaScript code uses the setInterval function to update the clock every second. It retrieves the current time using the Date object, extracts the hours, minutes, and seconds, and then displays these values on the HTML page.

The HTML code creates a basic structure for the clock using a div element with the class clock. Within this div, there are four div elements that display the hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM indicator of the current time. These values are displayed using span elements with the IDs hours, minutes, seconds, and ampm, respectively.

The CSS styles for the clock are defined in the style.css file, which is linked in the head section of the HTML document. The styles define the font size, color, and positioning of the clock elements.

Overall, this code creates a simple digital clock that can be displayed on a web page.</p>
