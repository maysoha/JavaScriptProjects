# Weather App

<p>The weather app allows the user to enter a city name in a form input field and retrieve the current weather conditions as well as the forecast for the next five days.

When the user submits the form, the app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve the weather data for the specified city. The app displays the weather information on the page, including the temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on the user's preference), the weather icon, the description, and additional details such as humidity, wind speed, and feels like temperature.

The app also updates the background image of the page based on the weather condition (e.g. if it's sunny, the background image will be a sunny landscape).

The app also displays the forecast for the next five days, showing the temperature and weather icon for each day at noon. The user can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit by clicking a switch button.

The app also displays the current date and time at the top of the page, and updates it every second.

If there is an error retrieving the weather data, the app displays an error message and hides the toggle button.</p>
