# ToDo App

<h3>A todo app is a software application designed to help users keep track of their tasks and to-dos. It typically allows users to create, edit, and organize tasks into lists and mark tasks as completed. A todo app can be used for personal or professional purposes, and can be particularly helpful for managing complex projects or busy schedules. It is implemented using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</h3>

<h2>The user story for the todo app is as follows:</h2>

- As a user, I want to be able to add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of things I need to do. I want to be able to mark tasks as completed and remove them from the list when I no longer need them. Additionally, I want to be able to filter the list to show only completed tasks, only incomplete tasks, or all tasks.
- As a user, when I open the app, I want to see any previously saved tasks that I haven't completed yet with the date and the time I added them. I should also be able to add new tasks to the list by entering text into an input field and clicking a button. If I try to submit an empty task, I should see an error message telling me to enter text.
- As a user, if I click on the "completed" button next to a task, it should be marked as completed and moved to the completed tasks section of the list. If I click the button again, it should be marked as incomplete and moved back to the incomplete tasks section of the list. If I click the "trash" button next to a task, it should be removed from the list entirely.
- As a user, Ii should be able to use a dropdown menu to filter the list to show only completed tasks, only incomplete tasks, or all tasks. When I select a filter option, the list should update immediately to show only the appropriate tasks.
