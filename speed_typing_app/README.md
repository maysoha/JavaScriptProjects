# Speed Typing Game

<h3>Speed typing game is a game that tests your typing skills by presenting you with a passage of text and timing how long it takes you to type it out. </h3>
The speed typing game functionality is implemented using JavaScript and involves generating a random quote using an external API and displaying it on the screen. The player must then type the quote as quickly and accurately as possible in the input field provided. The game keeps track of the time it takes for the player to complete the quote and calculates their typing speed (in characters per second) at the end.

The functionality also includes a game history feature that displays the details of past games, including the number of characters typed, the time taken to complete the quote, and the average speed in characters per second. The game history is stored in the browser's local storage.

The player can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button that appears after they complete the quote. Also, the playerr can reset the history of the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button. The game also includes error handling to highlight incorrect characters in the input field and prevent the player from submitting the quote until they have typed it correctly.
